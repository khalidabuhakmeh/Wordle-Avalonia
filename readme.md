# Wordle Game with Avalonia UI

This is a clone of the pop-sensation game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) written with [Avalonia UI](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/) and [JetBrains Rider](https://jetbrains.com/rider).

I am also using the CommunityToolkit.Mvvm package to do Model-View-ViewModel development.

Feel free to look through the code and submit an pull requests to improve the demo.
